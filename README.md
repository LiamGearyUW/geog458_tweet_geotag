# geog458_tweet_geotag
In this lab, I collected to sets of geotagged tweets. The first involved getting every geotagged tweet from the United States over the course of ten minutes in the afternoon of 4/20. The related map can be found labelled as "map 1," and the text of the tweets were used in the first word cloud. I'm not quite sure what I expected, but it's odd that "Out" was the most common word.

The second set of tweets were taken from Washington, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island over the course of twenty minutes in the late morning of 4/21. These states were chosen pretty arbitrarily, but I wanted to see if there would be any major difference between the country as a whole and some coastal metropolitan areas, i.e. Seattle and Boston. I live in Washington, and I have a friend in Massachusetts. I wanted to see if a tweet he produced while the program ran would get picked up. Sadly, it did not. Whether that's because the program only picks up some tweets at random or because it couldn't pick up any tweets made by people with location services turned off, I don't know. The second and third maps as well as the second word cloud are the result of this data. For some reason, the most common word was "Exit." Looking closer at the CSV file, this appears to be because the Connecticut Department of Transportation's many Twitter accounts post regular updates regarding traffic, road work, collisions, and the like, and most of those events happen at exits.
